## Overview
Table football, also known as foosball or table soccer, is a game based on as- sociation football. The objective is to move the ball into the opponent’s goal by manipulating rods with figures resembling football players of two opposing teams. This fast-paced game is typically played by 2-4 players, but it is not designed for solo play.
Our project proposes the creation of a Foosball table that can be played by a single player, with the help of an Arduino Uno board. Our vision involves a program executed from a computer connected to the microcontroller, controlling one side of the game, while a human player controls the other side. This system should at least be able to rotate the handles and displace them, considering two axes of movement per pole.
A traditional foosball table is as large as a standard table and has four handles per side. However, for the sake of our project’s budget and complexity, the prototype will be based on a smaller version with only two handles per side. This approach will reduce system complexity and improve motor reaction times.

### Building the table

### Wiring of the Motors
### Electronics Chart

#### Protecting the motors and your laptop
Always connect the Arduino via a USB-Isolator to your laptop and ideally don't charge your laptop while it is connected to the Arduino.
It is also important that you unplug the power and the Arduino before changing anything on the wiring or manually moving the motors.
Generally it is also advised to disconnect the power and the arduino whenever you're not using them.
Also note that the motor drivers on the CNC shield might head up a bit if used for a long period of time.

### Uploading code to the Arduino
#### Dependencies
You need to have [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) installed, as well as the libraries
#### Uploading Code
1. Open the code for the Arduino in `/Software/Algorithms/beginner/beginner.ino`
2. Connect the Arduino via the USB Isolator to your laptop
3. Press the upload button in the top left of the Arduino IDE

#### Troubleshooting
If you get a compilation error, check whether you have all libraries installed.

If you get an error while uploading, check whether you have selected the right board and port and try again.

### Camera Vision
#### QR Code Markers
You need to print out the 4 QR Code Markers stored in the file
[`/Software/Camera/cv/python-webcam/ArUco markers.pdf`](https://github.com/epfl-cs358/2024fa-foosbot/blob/main/Software/Camera/cv/python-webcam/ArUco%20markers.pdf)
and cut them out. 

<img width="359" alt="QRCodeMarkers" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/70fe4499-404d-41a1-beef-c1cddc03354b" />



You then have to tape the QR Codes into the Right corners. Note that the top left corner, marked red in image above, should point towards the corner.
Here is a picture from below the table where the motors are at the top:

__It is important that the Codes are oriented the right way!__
Otherwise the camera won't detect the full playing field.

#### Code
The code for the Camera Vision is located in the folder
[`/Software/Camera/cv/python-webcam/main.py`](https://github.com/epfl-cs358/2024fa-foosbot/blob/main/Software/Camera/cv/python-webcam/main.py)
#### Installing Dependencies
You need to have python installed on your computer (See [here](https://realpython.com/installing-python/) an article how to install python).
You als need the following libraries:
- [PySerial](https://pypi.org/project/pyserial/)
- [opencv](https://opencv.org/)

If you are on linux or macOS and have pip installed you can simply run 

```commandline
pip install pyserial
pip install opencv
```
If you're having trouble, check with your package manager whether it accepts pip installs.

#### Starting camera vision
Note that you have to close all Serial monitors in the ArduinoIDE since it prevents the computer vision from opening the port. You can open it again when the computer vision is running.
2. Plug in the Logitech webcam,
1. Plug in the Arduino UNO,
3. Navigate to folder ` Software/Camera/cv/python-webcam `,
4. Run ` ./main.py `.

If you want to know how to use different flags, type `./main.py --help`.

#### Troubleshooting

If the camera is not activating properly, try changing the parameter of the
call to the ` cv2.VideoCapture ` function to another number (usually 0 or 2).
You can also use the `-i` flag for that.
